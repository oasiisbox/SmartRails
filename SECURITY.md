## Security Measures

SmartRails implements several security practices:

- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Code review requirements for all changes
- Secure coding practices and linting rules
- Limited scope of operations (read-only analysis)

## Scope

This security policy applies to:

- The SmartRails CLI tool and its core functionality
- The web interface for report viewing
- Integration with external LLM services
- All dependencies and third-party components

## Out of Scope

The following are typically considered out of scope:

- Issues in dependencies that don't affect SmartRails functionality
- Theoretical vulnerabilities without proof of concept
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical access to systems running SmartRails

## Security Best Practices for Users

When using SmartRails:

1. Keep the gem updated to the latest version
2. Run `bundle audit` regularly to check for dependency vulnerabilities
3. Use secure API keys for LLM services
4. Review generated reports before sharing externally
5. Be cautious when using auto-fix features in production

## Contact
