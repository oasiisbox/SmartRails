## Coding Standards

### Ruby Style Guide

We follow the Ruby community style guide with some modifications. Run RuboCop to check your code:

```bash
bundle exec rubocop
```

### Code Organization

- Keep files focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful names for classes, methods, and variables
- Write self-documenting code with clear intent
- Add comments only when necessary to explain "why", not "what"

### Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Aim for fast, isolated unit tests

Example test structure:
```ruby
RSpec.describe SmartRails::Auditors::SecurityAuditor do
  describe '#check_csrf_protection' do
    context 'when CSRF protection is missing' do
      it 'adds a high severity issue' do
        # Arrange
        auditor = described_class.new(project_root)
        
        # Act
        auditor.run
        
        # Assert
        expect(auditor.issues).to include(
          a_hash_including(
            type: 'CSRF Protection',
            severity: :high
          )
        )
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### Documentation

- Update the README.md if you change functionality
- Add YARD documentation for public methods
- Include examples in your documentation
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## Creating New Auditors

If you're adding a new auditor:

1. Create a new file in `lib/smartrails/auditors/`
2. Extend `SmartRails::Auditors::BaseAuditor`
3. Implement the `#run` method
4. Add corresponding tests in `spec/smartrails/auditors/`
5. Update the audit command to include your auditor

Example:
```ruby
module SmartRails
  module Auditors
    class MyCustomAuditor < BaseAuditor
      def run
        # Your audit logic here
        check_something_important
        
        issues # Return the issues array
      end
      
      private
      
      def check_something_important
        # Check logic
        if problem_found?
          add_issue(
            type: 'Problem Type',
            message: 'Clear description of the problem',
            severity: :medium,
            file: 'path/to/problematic/file.rb',
            auto_fix: -> { fix_the_problem } # Optional
          )
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## Release Process

2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Commit changes: `git commit -m "Release version X.Y.Z"`
4. Create a git tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z`
5. Push changes: `git push origin main --tags`
6. Build and release gem: `rake release`
